## Background

This application is made to be used as a chatbox. Just type and it should work, It isnt the most complex, and it simply asks yes or no questions for you to answer. I used a few imports such as time and sys (sys to end, and time to make it "feel" smoother I guess).

## Install

Just load it into replit and run (not for your life, run the program).

## Usage

You need to type your name, of course, and then you must choose an emotion word (good, sad, angry, tired, hungry, unknown). Once each is selected, it will ask multiple different questions. Just answer yes or no... please...

## Test Plan
To test the project:

1. Run the test

2. Check the results

3. Submit report and push

### Any optional sections

Feel free to suggest new emotions. When I'm bored, I can update it.
